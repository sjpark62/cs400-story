This is x2 assingment for cs400.

The x2 assignment for cs400 sat untouched in the canvas homepage. It watched as
students logged in and completely ignored its presence. Would it ever get done?
Would this x2 assignment just sit until the due date passed without anyone
completing it? These questions haunted the x2 assignment daily until one day
a young man named Andrew logged on to canvas.
