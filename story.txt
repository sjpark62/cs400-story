This is x2 assingment for cs400.

The x2 assignment for cs400 sat untouched in the canvas homepage. It watched as
students logged in and completely ignored its presence. Would it ever get done?
Would this x2 assignment just sit until the due date passed without anyone
completing it? These questions haunted the x2 assignment daily until one day
a young man named Andrew logged on to canvas. Andrew was trying to think of what to write. There were so many opportunities for him to create wild twists and turns, but the thought of not getting the assignment done was lingering in his head, just as Brad thought when he was doing the same. He was quite worried the assignment won't get done on time.

Alas, the two decided that it was time to finish the assignment so the two met up and planning on finishing the assignment. They worked day and night 
trying their hardest to get the assignment done. They faced many challenges along the way. Many different bugs plagued the assignement but the two
men battled through the adversity to finally complete the assignment.
